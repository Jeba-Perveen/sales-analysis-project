##  Technical Implementation

### Data Loading
- Utilized **BULK INSERT** operations for efficient data loading from CSV files
- Implemented proper field terminators and handled first-row headers
- Applied `TABLOCK` for optimized performance

### Data Transformation
- Converted date columns from `NVARCHAR` to `DATE` data type
- Extracted city names from address fields using string manipulation functions
- Applied data cleaning and standardization techniques

##  Advanced Business Analytics

### 1. Top Selling Products
Identifies the top 10 products by total sales value, including quantity sold and revenue generated.

### 2. Revenue by Category
Calculates total revenue per product category with percentage contribution to overall revenue.

### 3. Average Order Value (AOV)
Computes AOV for customers with more than 5 orders to identify high-value customers.

### 4. Monthly Sales Trend
Tracks monthly sales performance with month-over-month comparison using window functions.

### 5. Customer Acquisition Analysis
Identifies registered customers who haven't made purchases for targeted marketing campaigns.

### 6. Best-Selling Category by City
Determines the top-performing product category in each city using ranking functions.

### 7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
Ranks customers based on their total purchase value for loyalty program optimization.

### 8. Inventory Stock Alerts
Monitors products with low stock levels and tracks last restock dates by warehouse.

### 9. Shipping Delays Analysis
Identifies orders with shipping delays exceeding 2 days for logistics improvement.

### 10. Payment Success Rate
Calculates payment success rates with breakdowns by payment status.

### 11. Top Performing Sellers
Ranks top 5 sellers by sales value with order status breakdown (delivered vs processing).

##  Key SQL Techniques Used

- **Aggregate Functions**: SUM, COUNT, AVG for data summarization
- **Window Functions**: RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG for advanced analytics
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: For complex query organization
- **Joins**: Multiple table joins for comprehensive data retrieval
- **Date Functions**: DATEDIFF, FORMAT for temporal analysis
- **String Functions**: SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, LTRIM, RTRIM for data extraction
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries for percentage calculations
- **CASE Statements**: Conditional logic for data transformation

## ðŸ“Š Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Total Revenue & Revenue Growth
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
- Payment Success Rate
- Shipping Performance Metrics
- Inventory Turnover
- Seller Performance Rankings
- Category-wise Revenue Distribution
